## Description
Challenge 19 coursework for UT bootcamp. Uses PWA structure, idb package for IndexedDB, and Heroku. </br>
This is a text editor that not only runs in-browser while online, but can be downloaded and used </br>
offline as well. It retrieves and stores data to an IndexedDB database, and features data </br>
persistence methods that can be relied on, in case the browser does not support certain options. </br>

## What I Have Learned
I have learned how PWAs (Progressive Web Applications) function as a client/server setting. </br>
The server hosts the routes (back-end) while the client hosts the css, images, js files, as </br>
well as the main index.html, service worker, and webpack configuration (front-end) for the program. </br>
Being able to download the application and use it offline is extremely useful. </br>
